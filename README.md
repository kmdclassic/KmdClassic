> **⚠️ WARNING: kmdclassic is experimental and a work-in-progress. Use at your own risk.**

## Overview

Komodo Classic (KMDCL) is a project that aims to restore Komodo to its original vision as conceived by its creator, jl777. Despite the fundraising campaign not reaching its goal, we have decided to proceed with the implementation because we believe in the original purpose of KMD as it was originally designed.

## Key Features & Advantages Over Original KMD

Komodo Classic will restore and maintain the core features that made Komodo unique:

- **Private Transactions**: KMDCL will include private transaction capabilities, restoring the privacy features that were part of the original Komodo vision.

- **5% APR User Rewards (Interest)**: Just as it was in the original KMD, KMDCL will feature a 5% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) reward system for users, providing interest on holdings as originally intended by the creator.

## Technical Foundation

This project is built on the **KomodoOcean** codebase, which was chosen for several important reasons:

- **GUI Support**: Full Qt-based graphical user interface for an enhanced user experience
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Performance**: This full node implementation is faster and more progressive than the original `komodod`
- **Modern Architecture**: Built on a more advanced and maintainable codebase

## Project Status

**Work on this project has just begun.** We will be providing regular updates on the progress of development here in this repository. 

**⚠️ Important**: Until the first official release is available, it is **too early to build and use** this project. The codebase is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.

## Origins & Vision

Komodo Classic traces its roots back to the original vision of jl777, the creator of Komodo. This project represents an effort to preserve and implement the foundational principles and features that were part of Komodo's original design, ensuring that the community has access to a version of Komodo that stays true to its creator's initial intent.
